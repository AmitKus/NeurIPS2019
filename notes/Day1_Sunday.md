## Presentation 1: Link Prediction

Predicting missing data flows in large communication networks.

Multiplex network: Undirected graph -> Set of undirected graph
Given a network: 
    What link are supposed to showup in future (predict future missing links)?

Applications:

    * Biological networks
    * Transportation Networks
    * Global trade networks
    * Social networks

Approach:

    * Simple, interpretable for unsupervised link prediction
    * Highly structured correlation

Concepts:

    * Erdos-Renyi Graph
    * Pierre-Auger Physics Collaboration Network
    * European Airlines Networks
    * Global Trade Network
    * The link prediction problem for social network (Liben-Nowell)


## Presentation 2: Privacy Preserving Analytics

Private Data ----> Train Model <------Secret Model

Secure multi-party Computation

Salary example: R+x1 -> R+X1+X2 -> R+X1+X2+X3 -> R+X1+X2+X3-R
