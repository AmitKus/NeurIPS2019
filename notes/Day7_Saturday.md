## Computation + Systems vs Climate Change by Jeff Dean


### Bayesian Inference

**Bayesian Inference -> Tensorflow Probability (TFP) -> Fusion Energy**

Holy grail: Breakeven Fusion

Plasma model on top of TFP

**Simulations -> TPU -> Flood forecasting**

### Flood forecast prediction

Physical measurement -> Hydrologic Model -> Hydraulic Model

**Paper: Zvika Ben-Haim et al, Inundiation ....**

**TPU-based simulations**

*TPU has high-speed Matrix Multiplication Unit (MXU)

**Simulation -> Neurla Network Proxies -> Tensorflow -> Weather Prediction**

## Solar Research: Photovoltaics Research Laboratory (MIT)

Physics-informed Bayseian Hierarchical Model

Neural Network Surrogate Model

## Cumulo: A dataset for learning cloud classes

clouds: the greatest for of uncertainty in global warming.

    1.classify clouds into types
    2.study their spatiotemporal variability

## Predictive inference of a wildfire risk pipeline in the US

Climate change presents a threat to wildfires globally

Wildfire risks to model. i.e. location, duration, perimeter, exposure. [Xi et. al.]

Occurence -> Duration -> Perimeter -> Exposure (Uncertainty propagation)

Centralized geospatial SQL database (PostGIS)

## RL Challenges

Technical RL challenges prompted by quest to aid human learning?

The book of why? Judea Pearl


# Understanding machine learning via exaclty solvable statistical physics by Lenka Zdeborova

Leo 1995
* Why don't heavily parametrized NN overfit the data?
* What is the effective number of parameters?
* Why doesn't backpropagation head for a poor local minima?

E. Mossel , Deep Learning Boot Camp in Simons Institute, Berkeley 2019

In data science, models are used to fit the data?

In physics, models are the main tool of understanding.

## Teacher-Student model

Teacher-Network: Generates the data.

Student-Network: Observes X, y the architecture network.

# Assesing the Robustness of Deep RL Algo by Michael Littmann


Started of with Explainable RL.\
Is any explanation is at all possible.
